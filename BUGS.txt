Bugs and Known Problems
=======================

AsciiDoc
--------
- A benign warning 'with will become a reserved keyword
  in Python 2.6' sometimes occurs when using Python 2.5-- it's
  harmless and will dishappear with Python 3.
- The `toc` attribute will be ignored if it's set in a custom user or
  document configuration file. This is because the default
  configuration file containing the document `[header]` is sourced
  before custom configuration files and the `toc` attribute is
  processed using conditional inclusion macros.
- The `\include1::[]` block macro does not work inside ListingBlocks
  or FilterBlocks. Use `\include::[]` instead.
- Reported line numbers in diagnostic messages are sometimes wrong.
- Block filters only work in a POSIX environment.
- Embedding open brace characters { in argument values can cause
  incorrect argument substitution.
- Attribute references in macro attribute lists can't be unescaped
  (with the exception of attribute list entry `\{0}`).
- Section numbering is incorrect when outputting HTML from a
  multi-part book type document. This is not a biggy since multi-part
  books are generally processed to DocBook.
- A row of apostrophes in an inline context throws AsciiDoc into an
  endless loop.
- Multiple comma separated command names in the manpage NAME section
  translate to a single DocBook `refname` instead of multiple
  `refname` elements.
