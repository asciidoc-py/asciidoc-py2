AsciiDoc ChangeLog
==================

:replacements.\bweb:: http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/

Version 8.3.2 (2009-01-01)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Added Gouichi Iisaka's Graphviz filter to distribution.
- The 'SidebarBlock' element can now be rendered with an 'abstract'
  style.
- Reorganized filters into a separate subdirectory for each filter.
- Updated `Makefile.in` and `MANIFEST` files to reflect new filters
  organization.
- Added 'listing' style to 'LiteralBlock' element so listings with
  nested listing blocks can be rendered as a listing block.
- Changed example 'code' filter to use preferred 'ListingBlock' syntax
  (the old `~` delimited filter syntax is no longer used).
- Hardwired 'CommentBlock' processing to ensure macros are not
  executed inside comment blocks.
- Implemented 'enumeration' and 'enumeration2' numbered list
  attributes for specifying the list numbering style ('arabic',
  'loweralpha', 'upperalpha', 'lowerroman' and 'upperroman').
- AsciiDoc now recognizes 'upperalpha', 'lowerroman' and 'upperroman'
  numbers in `listdef-numbered2` numbered lists and sets the number
  style based on the style of the first numbered list item
  (alternative to setting 'enumeration2' attribute).
- Updated `formatlistpat` definition in `.vimrc` example in User
  Guide.
- You can now backslash escape system block macros.
- Added 'Pychart' FAQ.
- Drop paragraph 'text' and list 'text', 'index' and 'label' match
  groups from attributes -- they are included in the element's text
  and we don't want them processed a second time as attributes.
- Changed comment line block macro to a passthrough block macro to
  ensure no substitutions.
- A 'subslist' no longer has to be appended to a 'PassthroughBlock'
  macro definition, if omitted no substitutions are performed.
- Code tidy up: replaced deprecated `<>` operator with `!=`.
- Removed unused linuxdoc code.
- Code tidy ups: dropped old types module reference; replaced
  `has_key()` with preferred `in` operator.


Version 8.3.1 (2008-12-14)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Replaced the `install.sh` script with Ben Walton's updated autoconf
  scripts -- see web:INSTALL.html[INSTALL] for details.
- Added a generalized 'AttributeEntry' syntax to allow arbitrary
  configuration file entries to be set from within an AsciiDoc
  document (suggested by Henrik Maier).
- Listing delimited blocks in DocBook outputs now support IDs; IDs of
  titled Listing and Literal delimited blocks have been moved to the
  enclosing DocBook example tag (thanks to Vijay Kumar for this
  patch).
- Replaced vertical typewriter apostrophe with punctuation apostrophe
  (thanks to Noah Slater).

.Bug fixes
- Regression: Excluding double-quotes from unquoted attribute values
  resulted in backward incompatibility, double-quotes in unquoted
  attribute values has been reinstated.
- Regression: Text like `&...;` was sometimes mistaken for an entity
  reference -- tightened up entity reference matching.


Version 8.3.0 (2008-11-29)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- web:newtables.html[AsciiDoc new tables] is a complete redesign of
  the tables syntax and generation. The new syntax and features are a
  huge improvement over the old tables. The old tables syntax has been
  deprecated but is currently still processed.
- web:newlists.html[Lists can now be styled] like other block
  elements. This allows a single list syntax for 'glossary', 'qanda'
  (Question and Answer) and 'bibliography' lists instead of having to
  remember a different syntax for each type.
- Inline passthroughs macros have been improved and block passthrough
  macros added. Attribute substitution can be optionally specified
  when the macro is called.
- The passthrough block has a fully transparent passthrough delimited
  block block style called 'pass'.
- The 'asciimath' and 'latexmath' web:userguide.html#X77[passthrough
  macros] along with 'asciimath' and 'latexmath'
  web:userguide.html#X76[passthrough blocks] provide a (backend
  dependent) mechanism for rendering mathematical formulas. There are
  web:latexmath.pdf[LaTeX Math], web:asciimathml.html[AsciiMathML] and
  web:latexmathml.html[LaTeXMathML] examples on the AsciiDoc website.
- Reimplemented and cleaned up filter processing based on a patch
  submitted by Kelly Anderson.  Uses the newer subprocess module
  instead of the deprecated popen2 module.  Now works in Win32 command
  shell.
- Addition FAQs, more documentation updates.
- Arbitrary HTML/XML entities can be entered in AsciiDoc source.
- Did away with the need for the `shaded-literallayout.patch` (thanks
  to Henrik Maier for this patch).
- Implemented 'page break' block macro.
- Added 'line breaks' and 'ruler' processing instructions to DocBook
  outputs  (thanks to Henrik Maier for this patch).
- Added 'deg' (degree) and 'wj' (word joiner) entity attributes
  (thanks to Henrik Maier).
- Tweaked DocBook 'indexterm2' macro to avoid white space preceding
  the term when used in table cells (thanks to Henrik Maier for this
  patch).
- Title elements now process the 'options' attribute like other block
  elements.
- Added `single quoted' element.
- Spaces on both sides of a -- em-dash are translated to thin space
  characters.
- Improved detection and reporting of malformed attribute lists.
- The list 'compact' style is now a list option.
- Added 'strong' labeled list option which makes the labels bold (HTML
  outputs only).
- Dropped unsupported 'linuxdoc' backend.
- Dropped deprecated 'xhtml-deprecated' (version 6) backend.
- Added 'breakable' and 'unbreakable' attribute options to tables to
  control table breaking across page boundaries (DocBook XSL/FO
  outputs). By and in collaboration with Henrik Maier.
- Added 'pgwide' attribute option to tables to table, block image,
  horizontal labeled lists.  Specifies that the element should be
  rendered across the full text width of the page irrespective of the
  current indentation (DocBook XSL/FO outputs). Thanks to Henrik Maier
  for this patch.
- Vim syntax highlighter: spaces before/after bullets no longer
  highlighted (which is ugly if using a theme that highlights with
  underlines).  Thanks to Donald Chai for this patch.
- Added `a2x(1)` `\--fop` option.
- Added `a2x(1)` `\--no-xmllint` option.
- Highlighted labelled list terms with the navy color in XHTML
  outputs.
- Use `w3m(1)` as default `a2x(1)` text format generator (fallback to
  `lynx(1)`).
- Changed callout formats in html4 and xhtml11 outputs to angle
  brackets to match source highlighter rendering.
- Macros now inject user defined `<optionname>-option` attributes into
  markup.
- Added IRC URLs to AsciiDoc inline macros.
- Added `depth` attribute to `include::[]` system macro.
- Added 'footnoteref' inline macro.
- Added 'stylesheet' XHTML attribute to specify additional custom CSS
  stylesheet.
- If a paragraph style is specified it will be added to the XHTML
  'class' attribute and DocBook 'role' attribute.
- Replacements can be set in a document using the reserved
  AttributeEntry name 'replacement'.
- The prefix for auto-generated section name IDs can be set with the
  'idprefix' attribute.

.Bug fixes
- Escaped quote skipped over leading and trailing quote instead of
  just the leading quote.
- Fixed bug that was causing false negative safe mode warnings (patch
  submitted by Julien Palmas).
- Placed priority of AttributeEntry, AttributeList and BlockTitle
  above Title.  This ensures an  AttributeEntry, AttributeList or
  BlockTitle followed by a same length leading ListingBlock delimiter
  is not mistaken for a two-line title.
- Vim syntax highlighter: fixed multi-line quoted text.
- Contstrained quote termination after non-space character enforced.
- Vim syntax highlighter: unterminated quoted text is no longer
  highlighted.
- Vim syntax highlighter: passthroughs now exactly match AsciiDoc
  semantics.
- Vim syntax highlighter: escaped quoted text, attribute references
  and inline macros are not highlighted.
- Vim syntax highlighter: TODO's highlighted in CommentBlocks (thanks
  to Scott Wall); non-greedy pass:[$$...$$].
- Vim syntax highlighter: Comment lines mistaken for vertical list
  labels (thanks to Scott Wall).
- Vim syntax highlighter: Single unmatched $$ mistakenly highlighted
  remaining text (patch contributed by Scott Wall).
- Callouts now work in source highlighted listing generated by
  dblatex.
- Fixed exception that occured if undefined attribute was present in
  filter command.
- AttributeList block can now follow a paragraph without intervening
  blank line.
- The include macro tabsize attribute is no longer propagated to
  nested includes.

.Omissions
The following features were implemented but then but removed from this
release:

- 'pi', 'cdata' and 'comment' passthrough macros and passthrough block
  styles (creeping featurism, use 'pass' macros instead).
- Generic 'tag' inline macro (creeping featurism, use 'pass' macros
  instead).

Compatibility issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 8.3.0 has a number of backward incompatibilities with respect
to the previous 8.2.7 release:

- The old table syntax is still processed but a 'DEPRECATED' warning
  is issued.
- Entity references have to be escaped with a backslash.
- You have to explicitly precede horizontal style labeled lists with
  the `[horizontal]` style attribute -- by default all labeled lists
  are rendered vertically.
- The list 'compact' style has been dropped and is now a list option
  (use `options="compact"` in attribute lists).
- AsciiDoc version 6 sytnax no longer supported.
- Linuxdoc been removed from the distribution.
- The unsupported experimental 'latex' backend has not been tested on
  this release.
- The introduction of single-quote quoting requires that double-quote
  quoting is escaped with two backslashes.


Version 8.2.7 (2008-07-04)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Added `dvi`, `ps` and `tex` output format options to a2x(1).
- Added `--dblatex` option to a2x(1) so `dblatex(1)` can be used to
  generate PDFs.
- Added custom `dblatex(1)` configuration files (in distribution
  `./dblatex` directory) that are used by a2x(1).
- `dblatex(1)` is now used to generate the distributed PDF version of
  the AsciiDoc User Guide.
- If you don't need a customized the link caption you can enter the
  'http', 'https', 'ftp', 'file' URLs and email addresses without any
  special macro syntax -- you get the links by just cutting and
  pasting URLs and emails addresses. This also makes it easier to open
  links directly form AsciiDoc source ( most editors allow you to open
  URLs directly).  The Vim syntax highlighter has been updated to
  reflect these changes.
- Highlighted source code paragraphs have been implemented -- it's a
  much more convenient way to enter short code examples (see
  http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/source-highlight-filter.html[the
  online docs]).
- The source highlighter and music filter syntax has changed -- they
  now used the ListingBlock syntax customized with 'source' and
  'music' style attribute values. This follows the Paragraph styling
  convention introduced by the source paragraph (previous item) and is
  easier to read. The old syntax still works but has been deprecated.
- QuoteBlocks now have a 'verse' style -- you no longer have to nest a
  'verse' LiteralBlock inside a QuoteBlock for verses.  The 'verse'
  style on the LiteralBlock has been deprecated (still works though)
  and the 'style' attribute is positional attribute 1, pushing
  'attribution' and 'citetitle' attributes to the right (you'll need
  to insert a 'quote' attribute into your existing QuoteBlocks).
- It is no up to the DocBook processor to highlight source code syntax
  in `<programlisting>` elements rather than GNU Highlighter -- this
  is the correct way to handle it, plus `dblatex(1)` makes a much
  better job.
- 'scaledwidth' and 'align' attributes have been added to the 'image'
  macro. They apply to DocBook outputs (specifically for PDF
  documents). 'scaledwidth' sets the image size as a percent of the
  available page width; 'align' applies 'left', 'center' or 'right'
  horizontal image justification.
- Added a2x(1) `\--fop-opts=FOP_OPTS` option (patch submitted by Miklos
  Vajna).
- Added a2x(1) `\--dblatex-opts=DBLATEX_OPTS` option.
- Added Mikhail Yakshin's FOP 0.95 patch which fixes a long-standing
  `fo.xsl` problem and allows PDF's to be generated with FOP 0.95
  (previously had to use FOP 0.20.5).
- The User Guide has been updated and outdated FOP configuration and
  installation sections removed.

.Bug fixes
- Fixed `stylesheets/xhtml11-manpage.css` not being included when
  'linkcss' attribute was used.
- Configuration file `*-style` attributes are now dumped correctly.
- Fixed 'FAILED: malformed section entry' LaTeX backend error.

See the also the https://sharesource.org/hg/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc
repository changelog].


Version 8.2.6 (2008-04-29)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Enhancements to the Vim AsciiDoc syntax highlighter, for example,
  quoted text is now highlighted in titles and macro captions.
- If you define the `data-uri` intrinsic attribute images referenced
  by 'image' macros will be embedded in XHTML using the
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data:_URI_scheme[data: URI scheme].
  *NOTE*: Microsoft browser support for the 'data: URI scheme' is
  currently limited to MSIE 8 beta 1.
- Added `toc-title` attribute to allow custom table of contents
  titles.
- Added references to Alex Efros's AsciiDoc Cheatsheet to AsciiDoc
  website.
- `asciidoc(1)` and `a2x(1)` man pages formatted to conform to
  `man-pages(7)` recommendations.
- Old code-filter syntax (pre-8.1.0) is no longer recognized so that
  malformed two-line level 2 titles are no longer confused with
  'code-filter' block delimiters.
- Added -> <- => <= arrow replacements from the Arrows block of
  Unicode.
- Added DocBook refentry lang attribute -- patch contributed by
  VMiklos.
- AttributeEntry names can now be numeric (``named macro targets'').
- Hide Table of Contents title if Table of Contents empty -- patch
  contributed by Alex Efros.
- Various XHTML CSS tweaks.
- Code cleanup:
  * Replaced `realpath()` with Python 2.2 `os.path.realpath()` library
    function.
  * Replaced old string library functions with string methods.
  * Use file generators instead of `readlines()`.
  * Renamed entities that shadowed builtins.
  * Standardized string quoting.
  * Dropped `readlines()` function.

.Bug fixes
- Fixed broken CSS for decimal ordered lists nested in alpha ordered
  list, thanks to Alex Efros.
- A missing closing block delimiter now reports the opening delimiter
  line number instead of the end of file line number.
- Fixed an error generated by the asciidoc `-e` option when there are
  no block definitions -- patch contributed by Alejandro Mery.
- Handle both `\r\n` (as well as `\n`) line separators that may be
  returned by `\{sys}` attribute evaluation.
- Numbered attribute names no longer interfere with positional
  attribute list values.


Version 8.2.5 (2007-11-18)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes

.Bug fixes
- Fixed exception thrown by illegal command-line arguments.
- Rolled back the 'with' warning bug fix introduced in 8.2.4 -- it was
  incompatible with Python <2.5.


Version 8.2.4 (2007-11-10)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- You can now use the `lang` attribute to set the DocBook language
  attribute.
- Attribute values can now contain attribute references.
- If the `lang` attribute is defined then configuration files named
  like `lang-<lang>.conf` will be loaded automatically.
- The help file name `help-<lang>.conf` is based on the AsciiDoc
  `lang` attribute, defaults to `help.conf` (English).
- Admonition, figure and table captions have been factored into a
  predefined set of `caption_*` attributes.  They only apply to
  directly generated (X)HTML outputs (DocBook stylesheets generate
  their own language specific captions based on the `lang` attribute).
- Dropped platform dependent `doc/asciidoc.chm` file from
  distribution documentation formats.

.Bug fixes
- The spurious warning 'with will become a reserved keyword
  in Python 2.6' has been suppressed.


Version 8.2.3 (2007-09-12)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Added VMiklos's 'permalink' patch for auto-generated section IDs
  (enabled by default by the `sectids` attribute).
- Added http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/faq.html[FAQ] to website.
- Changed format of \{localdate} attribute to ISO 8601 (`%Y-%m-%d`).
- Added `abc2ly --beams=None` option to make `music2png.py` conform to
  ABC's notion of beams.
- XHTML level 2 section headings are now styled with an underlining
  border.
- XHTML links to AsciiDoc title elements are now implemented with
  title ID attributes (previously separate `<a>` element targets were
  generated.
- Multi-word first, middle and last names can be entered in the header
  author line using the underscore as a word separator.
- The nested inline macros restriction has now been lifted, for
  example you can now include links and inline images inside
  footnotes.
- Help topic names can be shortened (so long as they are not
  ambiguous). For example `asciidoc -hm` will print the AsciiDoc man
  page.
- Added `\{two_colons}` and `\{two_semicolons}` attributes for
  escaping labeled list ambiguity.
- If quirks mode is disabled the XHTML Mime Type is set to the
  recommended `application/xhtml+xml` (rather than `text/html`).

.Bug fixes
- Author information is now correctly set when using attribute entries
  in the header instead of an author line (previously the 'author'
  attribute was not being calculated correctly and there were
  attribute substitution problems).


Version 8.2.2 (2007-07-22)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- http://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/drw/lm.html[LaTeXMathML]
  capability has been added for users who are more familiar with or
  prefer LaTeX math formulas to the
  http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/asciimath.html[ASCIIMathML]
  notation (thanks to Arthur Sakellariou for the patch).
- The 'source highlight' and 'code' filters now process embedded
  callouts.
- Added an `--attribute=ATTRIBUTE` option to `a2x(1)` for passing
  attribute values to asciidoc(1) (a shortcut for `--asciidoc-opts="-a
  ATTRIBUTE"`).
- Image block and inline macros prepend optional `\{imagesdir}`
  attribute to image link targets.


.Bug fixes
- Fixed an assertion error that occurred when a configuration file
  containing an `\include::[]` macro was loaded using the
  `\--conf-file` option and the configuration file name did not
  include an explicit directory path -- patch submitted by Dmitry
  Potapov.
- Asciidoc titles are only converted to lower case if all characters
  are upper case otherwise case is left unchanged -- patch submitted
  by Dmitry Potapov.
- Added a missing check that input is not stdin before loading
  configuration files from the document directory -- patch submitted
  by Dmitry Potapov.
- Attribute list items must evaluate to strings, numbers or None
  (previously it was possible to evaluate to other object types which
  resulted in surprising attribute values).
- If an AsciiDoc document has no title an empty XHTML 1.1 'title'
  element is created -- previously the 'title' element was dropped
  which resulted in invalid XHTML 1.1.
- The Vim syntax file no longer highlights escaped callouts.
- The Vim syntax highlighter now correctly highlights Double-dollar
  passthroughs when they enclose dollar delimited ASCIIMathML and
  LaTeXMathML formulas.


Version 8.2.1 (2007-04-06)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- A number of improvements have been made to the Vim syntax
  highlighter, for example the word C++ is no longer mistaken for the
  start of an unconstrained monospace quote.
- Labeled list definitions have been tightened -- a list label can no
  longer containing trailing spaces. The following example is no
  longer recognized as a valid list label:

  Lorum ipsum ::
+
This change implements the originally intended behavior (as per the
AsciiDoc documentation and examples) so there should be very few
compatibility issues.

.Bug fixes


Version 8.2.0 (2007-04-04)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- A Vim syntax file is now included in the AsciiDoc distribution
  (inspired by Felix Obenhuber's `asciidoc.vim` script). You can find
  it (along with a Vim filetype detection script in the distribution
  `./vim/` directory (the scripts are installed automatically by the
  AsciiDoc installer `./install.sh`). See 'Appendix J' of the
  'AsciiDoc User Guide' for details.
- Added 'toclevel' attribute (1..4) which sets the number of title
  levels reported in the table of contents.  Defaults to 2 and must be
  used with the 'toc' attribute. Example usage:

  $ asciidoc -a toc -a toclevels=3 doc/asciidoc.txt

- Added a `listindex` attribute which is the current list item index
  (1..). If this attribute appears outside a list its value is the
  number of items in the most recently closed list.
- The single line titles syntax now accepts trailing suffixes -- this
  syntax matches the title line syntax of a number of popular Wiki
  markups.
- If a QuoteBlock has no attribution or citetitle then the DocBook
  `<attribution>` element is not generated (previously generated empty
  `<attribution>` element).
- If the text of a labeled list item is blank then no `texttag` is
  written.
- An end of line backslash performs line continuation for horizontal
  labeled list items.
- The Revision line now accommodates Subversion `$Id` markers (in
  addition to CVS and RCS markers). Thanks to Tiago Sturmer Daitx for
  this patch.
- Implemented `a2x(1)` option `--skip-asciidoc` which allows `a2x(1)`
  to convert DocBook XML files not derived from AsciiDoc sources.
- If `a2x(1) --doctype` option is not specified it defaults to
  `manpage` if `--format=manpage` else defaults to `article`
  (previously `--doctype` always defaulted to `article`).
- Added an 'External Resources' section to the
  http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[AsciiDoc home page].

.Bug fixes


Version 8.1.0 (2006-10-22)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- AsciiDoc generated XHTML documents now display a table of contents
  if the 'toc' attribute is defined (JavaScript needs to be enabled
  for this to work).  Thanks to Troy Hanson who contributed this
  feature based on a JavaScript by Mihai Bazon. I've simplified things
  somewhat to match Docbook XSL Stylesheets style, see Troy's
  http://tpl.sourceforge.net/userguide.html[tpl User Guide] for a
  fancier layout. Use the `-a toc -a numbered` command-line options to
  produce a number table of contents.
- A http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/music-filter.html[music filter]
  is included in the distribution `./filters/` directory.  It
  translates music in http://lilypond.org/[LilyPond] or
  http://abcnotation.org.uk/[ABC] notation to standard classical
  notation in the form of a trimmed PNG image which is inserted into
  the AsciiDoc output document.
- Incorporated Paul Melis's Win32 filter patch.  This workaround
  allows AsciiDoc to run filters under Windows.
- Added `uninstall.sh` script.
- Rather than proliferate a confusing number of filter block
  delimiters the following convention has been adopted: delimiters
  belonging to DelimitedBlock filters distributed with AsciiDoc will
  consist of a word (normally a noun identifying the block content)
  followed by four or more tilde characters.  This has necessitated
  changing existing filter delimiters (the old delimiters still work
  but may be deprecated in future versions):

  * The example code filter block delimiter is now the word `code`
    followed by four or more tilde characters.
  * The source highlight filter block delimiter is now the word
    `source` followed by four or more tilde characters.

- Conditionally redefined subscript and superscripting so they use the
  old replacements mechanism when asciidoc7compatible is defined
  rather than the asciidoc 8 default unconstrained quoting (patch for
  affected files attached).
- Moved the source highlight filter from `./examples/` to `./filter/`.
- Added `\{verbose}` intrinsic attribute (useful for passing verbose
  flag to filters).
- Added `\{outdir}` intrinsic attribute.
- Renamed `\{docdir}` intrinsic attribute to unambiguous`\{indir}`
  (`\{docdir}` still works but may be removed in future release).
- If `asciidoc(1)` outputs to stdout then intrinsic attribute
  `\{docname}` is extracted from the input file name.


Version 8.0.0 (2006-08-27)
--------------------------
*********************************************************************
This is a major release because changes to quoting and index entry
handling may break existing documents (see 'Additions and changes'
below and 'Appendix A: Migration Notes' in the AsciiDoc User Guide).

Please report any problems you encounter.

mailto:srackham@gmail.com['Stuart Rackham']
*********************************************************************

.Additions and changes
- Quoting can can occur within words (based on patch submitted by
  Benjamin Klum). See the 'Unconstrained Quotes' sub-section in the
  User Guide.

- The underline and plus characters can be used as alternatives to the
  existing apostrophe and backtick quote characters. They are arguably
  better choices than the apostrophe and backtick as they are not
  confused with punctuation.

- The syntax for index entry macros have have been deprecated from
  `\+...\+` and `\++...++` to `\((...))` and `\(((...)))` respectively.
  Rationale:
  * Bracketing is consistent other with `[[...]]` and `<<...>>`
    reference macros.
  * To easily confused with triple plus passthroughs.
  * To make way for the new monospace quoting.

- Superscripts and subscripts are implemented as constrained quotes so
  they can now be escaped with a leading backslash and prefixed with
  with an attribute list.

- An experimental LaTeX backend has been written by Benjamin Klum (a
  number additions in this release are to accommodate the LaTeX
  backend).
- `include` macro file names now expand environment variables and
  tilde expansions.
- A configuration file `[quotes]` entry can be undefined by setting to
  a blank value.
- Added `callto` inline macro for Skype 'callto' links.
- Added `colnumber` attribute for table data markup.
- A leading comment block or comment lines are now skipped (previously
  a document had to start with either attribute entries or a document
  Title).
- Experimental `rows` attribute (number of source lines in table)
  available in table markup templates (used by experimental LaTeX
  backend).
- Included install shell script written by mailto:jlm@ofb.net[Jacob
  Mandelson] for installing the tarball distribution.
- Added INSTALL documentation file.
- Added 'replacements2' substitution options -- a second replacements
  section.
- Added the ability to redefine 'normal' and 'verbatim' substitutions
  with `subsnormal` and `subsverbatim` entries in configuration file
  `[miscellaneous]` section.
- By default `AttributeEntry` values are substituted for
  `specialcharacters` and `attributes`, if you want a different
  AttributeEntry substitution set the `attributeentry-subs` attribute.
- The `name` in `name=value` configuration file entries can now end
  with a backslash, just escape the trailing backslash with a
  backslash. For example:

  abc\\=xyz
+
Results in `name=abc\` and `value=xyz` --  previously this would have
escaped the `=` character.

- A blank configuration file section deletes any preceding section
  with the same name (applies to non-markup template sections).
- A command-line attribute value with a `@` suffix does not override
  existing document and configuration file attributes (normally
  command-line attributes have precedence over document and
  configuration file attributes).
- `localtime` attribute is now encoded from the native system encoding
  to the output encoding. Patch submitted by
  mailto:m_pupil@yahoo.com.cn[FKtPp] -- here's his description of the
  problem:

``I am a Chinese user of AsciiDoc and I find that when I use UTF-8
(the default encoding) to write asciidoc documents in Windows platform
the resulting html footer line will get screwed. It was caused by a
localized tzname that was always encoded in the windows native
encoding, which in my case is 'cp936'.''

- a2x(1) can generate Open Document Text files using
  http://open.comsultia.com/docbook2odf/[docbook2odf]. Currently
  `docbook2odf(1)` only processes a subset of DocBook, unimplemented
  elements are skipped.
- The a2x(1) format option defaults to `xhtml` (previously a format
  had to be specified explicitly).
- The `-d, \--doctype=DOCTYPE` option has been added to a2x(1) which
  is a shortcut for `\--asciidoc-options="\--doctype=DOCTYPE"`.
- Replaced a2x(1) `\--no-icons` and `\--no-copy` options with their
  negated equivalents: `\--icons` and `\--copy` respectively. The
  default behavior has also changed: copying and use of icons is
  disabled by default. Rationale:
  * To make the default behavior more consistent since use of icons
    and CSS stylesheets does not apply to all formats.
  * To make the default behavior less surprising (the creation of icon
    and stylesheet output files must now be explicit).

- a2x(1) has been bumped from version 0.1.1 to version 1.0.0.


.Bug fixes
- Removed duplicate `./doc/a2x.1.txt` from distribution tarball.
- Documentation errata.
- Attribute replacement is no longer performed twice in Titles and
  AttributeEntrys.
- a2x(1) skipped asciidoc(1) execution when rerun with different
  `\--asciidoc-options` options, it now always executes asciidoc(1).
  The problem was that previously asciidoc(1) was executed only if the
  output file was missing or older than the source file.


Version 7.1.2 (2006-03-07)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Support for
  http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html[ASCIIMathML]
  has been added. See 'Appendix I: ASCIIMathML Support' in the User
  Guide and the examples at
  http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/asciimath.html.
- You can now prefix quoted text with inline attributes lists.  You
  can use this to set font size and color (XHTML and HTML outputs).
- Added `\##...\##` quoting -- it does nothing -- it's purpose is to
  allow inline attributes to be applied to normal text.
- An link:userguide.html#X50[inline passthrough] mechanism has been
  implemented.
- Configuration file comment lines can be escaped with a backslash --
  this is to allows the inclusion of configuration lines that start
  with a hash character.
- The `scriptsdir` attribute can be used to specify the name of the
  directory containing linked JavaScripts (see the
  link:userguide.html#X33[User Guide] for details.
- The BackendBlock has been renamed PassthroughBlock for consistency
  with the new inline passthrough naming.
- `a2x(1)` now works with the older `bash(1)` version 2.05b. Patch
  submitted by mailto:francis@daoine.org[Francis Daly].
- Content included by the `\include1::[]` system macro is no longer
  subject to attribute substitution so that ambiguities no longer
  arise when used to include CSS or JavaScript files.


Version 7.1.1 (2006-02-24)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- The `caption` attribute can be used to customize admonition captions
  as well as image, table and example block element title prefixes
  (`xhtml11` and `html4` backends).
- You can now override the default icon image using the `icon`
  attribute to specify the path of the linked image (xhtml11 and html4
  backends only).
- The deprecated `imagesdir` attribute is no longer recognized (use
  `iconsdir` instead).
- Added 'Appendix H: Using AsciiDoc with non-English Languages' to the
  AsciiDoc User Guide.
- Added 'Admonition Icons and Captions' subsection to the User Guide
  explaining how to customize Admonition elements.

.Bug fixes
- `a2x(1)` failed when configuration files were installed in the
  global `/etc/asciidoc/` directory -- it was only searching the
  directory containing the asciidoc executable (thanks to Christian
  Wiese for finding and submitting a patch this bug).
- The html4 backend admonition caption now correctly displays the
  admonition `caption` attribute (previously displayed the `style`
  attribute).


Version 7.1.0 (2006-01-13)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- `a2x(1)` toolchain wrapper utility.  This overcomes the biggest
  hurdle for new users which seems to be assembling and using a
  working DocBook XML toolchain. With `a2x(1)` you can generate XHTML
  (chunked and unchunked), PDF, man page, HTML Help and text file
  outputs from an AsciiDoc input file with a single command.  All you
  need to install (in addition to AsciiDoc) is xsltproc(1), DocBook XSL
  Stylesheets and optionally FOP (if you want PDF) or lynx(1) (if you
  want text).
- Block titles can now start with any non-space character (previously
  where not allowed to start with `.~-_` characters).
- `./stylesheets/docbook.css` renamed to
  `./stylesheets/docbook-xsl.css` to clarify its function.
- Renamed `./docbook-xsl/manpages.xsl` to `./docbook-xsl/manpage.xsl`
  for consistency.
- Admonition and navigation icons moved to `./images/icons/` to
  clarify usage and conform with a2x(1) usage.
- Renamed xhtml11 intrinsic attribute `imagesdir` to `iconsdir` to
  keep vocab consistent and changed default value to `./images/icons`
  (previously `./images`). `imagesdir` attribute still accepted but
  deprecated.
- Unused image files have been weeded out of the distribution.
- Packager notes (appendix B) have been updated to reflect the needs
  of `a2x(1)`.

IMPORTANT: The renaming of the xhtml11 backend `imagesdir` intrinsic
attribute and it's new default value introduces a backward
compatibility issue: if you use the `icons` attribute you will need to
either move your icons to the new default `./images/icons` location or
include an `--attribute{nbsp}iconsdir="your_icons_path"` option in
your asciidoc commands.

.Bug fixes
- Backslash line continuation is now observed in verbatim paragraphs.
- Fixed errors generated by example
  `./examples/website/build-website.sh` script.


Version 7.0.4 (2005-12-08)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Added ternary conditional attributes
  `\{<name>@<regexp>:<value1>[:<value2>]}` and
  `\{<name>$<regexp>:<value1>[:<value2>]}`.
- Safety violations now generate errors (they previously generated
  warnings).
- asciidoc(1) now defaults to safe mode, consequently the
  `[miscellaneous]` safe mode entry and `--safe` command-line option
  are no longer necessary (though for backward compatibility
  asciidoc(1) still accepts the `--safe` option).
- Backend Blocks are now flagged unsafe (they could be used to include
  arbitrary and hence potentially unsafe output content).
- Filters are no longer considered unsafe. There's not much point in
  insisting on filter safety since the installation of an unsafe
  filter would require the introduction of new or modified
  configuration files -- if your application configurations can be
  compromised you're in all sorts of trouble (safe mode protects
  against unsafe input files not unsafe configuration).  As with all
  filters, before installing, you should verify that they can't be
  coerced into generating malicious output or exposing sensitive
  information.

.Bug fixes
- Fixed a lot of glaring grammatical and factual errors in the User
  Guide.


Version 7.0.3 (2005-12-01)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Added `--safe` and `--unsafe` command-line options -- AsciiDoc can
  now be executed in a 'safe mode' which disallows the execution of
  arbitrary code or the inclusion of arbitrary files (see
  link:userguide.html#X39[Appendix C in the AsciiDoc User Guide]).
- Included link:source-highlight-filter.html[source-highlight filter]
  in the distribution `./examples/source-highlight-filter/` directory
  (based on filter submitted by mailto:trolocsis@gmail.com[Ryan
  Phillips]).
- Included the DocBook XSL Stylesheets 1.69.1 customizations used to
  generate the distributed AsciiDoc documentation (read the
  `asciidoc-docbook-xsl.txt` file in the distribution `./docbook-xsl/`
  directory).
- AsciiDoc DocBook XSL Stylesheet drivers moved from `./doc/` to
  `./docbook-xsl/`.
- Modified `./doc/manpages.xsl` so only URL content is displayed in
  manpages.

.Bug fixes
- Explicitly set table CSS border style (`xhtml11` backend) to `solid`
  because default border styles vary from browser to browser.


Version 7.0.2 (2005-08-28)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- There are now long versions of all AsciiDoc options.
- If the `--backend` is not specified it defaults to `xhtml11`.
- Added CSS simulated frames layout to the examples website (see
  `./examples/website/layout2/README-website.txt`). This layout does
  not work with IE6 and the original tables based layout is still the
  default.
- Support page added to AsciiDoc website.

.Bug fixes
- Invalid options are now trapped gracefully.
- Documentation errata.


Version 7.0.1 (2005-06-24)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Reverted to use of `strong`, `em`, `tt` XHTML tags -- they're more
  obvious and no less correct than `span` tags, besides, the generated
  file sizes are smaller (the 'User Guide' was 11% smaller).
- Table title rendered with `caption` tag rather than a separate
  `div`.
- The AsciiDoc 'stylesdir' attribute (if specified) is now recognized
  when searching for embedded stylesheets (previously only searched
  default `./stylesheets` directory).
- Default charset encoding changed from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 -- it's
  less language specific and displays most common languages.
- `\template::[]` macros now expand in all configuration file sections
  previously only in markup template sections.
- Cleaned up example website layout CSS and configuration
  (presentation has not been changed).
- Refactored `xhtml11.conf` configuration file.
- Set consistent and sensible permissions on distributed files.
- White space is now stripped from DSV formatted table cell data.
- `class="tableblock"` attribute added to tables generated by
  `xhtml-deprecated-css.conf` to assist CSS.

.Bug fixes
- Illegal character set encoder (specified by the AsciiDoc `encoding`
  attribute) and character data are trapped gracefully.
- AsciiDoc table 'format' attribute in table attribute lists were not
  recognized.
- The nested horizontal labeled list example in the 'AsciiDoc User
  Guide' has been dropped -- it generated invalid DocBook markup.


Version 7.0.0 (2005-06-06)
--------------------------
***************************************************
This is a major release with many code and
documentation changes.
Please report any problems you encounter.

mailto:srackham@gmail.com['Stuart Rackham']
***************************************************

.Additions and changes
- A new 'xhtml11' backend generates XHTML 1.1 with integrated CSS2
  replacing the previous 'xhtml', 'css', and 'css-embedded' backends.
- The CSS stylesheets have finally been rewritten.
- The asciidoc(1) command help now includes user
  link:userguide.html#X36[customizable help] topics. When asciidoc is
  invoked with the `\--help` option the command argument is
  interpreted as a help topic.
- The previous example website has been replaced by the actual
  AsciiDoc website (see `./examples/website/`.
- XHTML generation options now controlled by the following attributes:
  'badges', 'linkcss', 'icons', 'numbered', 'quirks', 'theme',
  'stylesdir', 'imagesdir' (see the link:userguide.html#X33[User
  Guide] for details.
- By default HTML and XHTML are output as stand-alone documents (no
  embedded CSS and no linked admonition icon images).
- Documents encoded with the UTF-8 Unicode character set are now
  processed thanks to a patch supplied by
  mailto:viktor@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de[Viktor Vasilev].
- The `-a ^name` command-line syntax to undefine an attribute has been
  deprecated in favor of the `-a name!` syntax.
- AttributeEntry syntax addition: `:name!:` to undefine `name` attribute.
- Added `template` system block macro to allow the inclusion of one
  configuration file template section within another.
- A 'verse' style attribute can now be applied to literal paragraphs
  and blocks to reproduce line breaks and white space from the source
  document.
- Replacements and Special Words can now be escaped with leading
  backslashes.
- Replacements are now processed in configuration file order (previous
  ordering was indeterminate).
- System macros can now be used in the base `asciidoc.conf`
  configuration file.
- Deprecated features that emitted warnings in prior versions are no
  longer tolerated.
- The `eval` system attribute expression evaluates to `False` the
  attribute is undefined, if it evaluates to `True` the result is an
  empty string.
- The Paragraph and DelimitedBlock 'presubs' parameter can be aliased
  as 'subs'.
- Added 'verbatim' substitutions option.
- Renamed 'List Continuation Block' to 'List Block' and renamed the
  'listcontinuation' option to 'list'.
- Deprecated 'default' substitutions option (use 'normal' instead).
- The 'section-numbers' section numbering attribute has be renamed
  'numbered'.
- Dropped the '\#UNDER CONSTRUCTION#' block macro.
- Rewrote Paragraph and DelimitedBlock handlers adding a
  link:userguide.html#X23[styles] configuration entry.

.Bug fixes
- Included files are no longer read inside conditionally excluded
  content.
- Manpage command names containing dashes (in the manpage NAME
  section) were misinterpreted as the spaced dash command name/purpose
  separator.  Bug report and patch supplied by
  mailto:david@dgreaves.com[David Greaves].
- Unexpected error following malformed author line error.


Version 6.0.3 (2005-04-20)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Special characters are now substituted in AttributeEntry element
  values.
- Spaced and unspaced em dashes are now recognized (previously only
  spaced em dashes were recognized).
- Replaced the table 'noborders' option with richer 'frame' and 'grid'
  attributes.
- The `duplicate macro` warning message now only occurs when the
  verbose (`-v`) option is enabled.
- Single lines starting with two forward slashes hard up against the
  left margin are treated as comments and are not processed.
- Renamed 'section' delimited block option to 'sectionbody' to more
  accurately reflect it's role.
- Added a List Continuation block -- a specialized delimited block
  that is functionally equivalent to the List Item Continuation
  feature except that the list contained within the block does not
  require explicit '+' list item continuation lines.
- Dropped deprecated `<u>` tags from generated HTML.
- Literal Block delimiters must now consist of at least four points
  (previously three) to avoid lone ellipsis ambiguity.

.Bug fixes
- Some system attribute evaluation failures caused unexpected
  exceptions to occur.


Version 6.0.2 (2005-03-30)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- Three new 'system' block macros have been added -- `eval`, `sys` and
  `sys2` which are the block macro equivalents to the same named
  system attributes.
- 'Intrinsic' macros have been renamed 'system' macros along with
  'action' attributes which have been renamed 'system' attributes:
  * To reflect their common (though contextually different) behavior.
  * To avoid confusion with 'intrinsic attributes'.

.Bug fixes
- Asciidoc now searches in `/etc/asciidoc/filters` for filters.


Version 6.0.1 (2005-03-06)
--------------------------
.Additions and changes
- A global configuration file location `/etc/asciidoc` has been added
  and is now processed before all other locations (patch supplied by
  mailto:stone@debian.org[Fredrik Steen]).
- Recoded `tempfile.mktemp()` and other artifacts that are no longer
  necessary or desirable (patches supplied by
  mailto:stone@debian.org[Fredrik Steen]).
- Added BUGS file to the distribution.

.Bug fixes
- Illegal comment syntax in `css-embedded-stylesheet.conf` resulted in
  illegal CSS in files generated by the `css-embedded` backend.


Version 6.0.0 (2005-01-28)
--------------------------
***************************************************
This release has had some fairly major code and
documentation changes. Please report any problems
you encounter.

mailto:srackham@gmail.com['Stuart Rackham']
***************************************************

A lot of new stuff. A new major version number -- some regression
incompatibility (hopefully mitigated by 'deprecated' warnings).

Went mad trying to rein in the current feature anarchy -- established
a unified notion of document attributes. Attempted to introduce a
consistent vocabulary -- renamed many poorly or inconsistently named
entities.

Actually, deprecated syntax is still processed correctly in almost all
cases. One source of incompatibility that may arise if you have
customized CSS stylesheets is the change of AsciiDoc CSS class names
(see below). I guess the moral is if you've done a lot of
configuration file customization and are happy with version 5 then you
may want to stay put.

NOTE: This version requires Python 2.3 or better to run.

.Additions and changes
- 'Glossary entries' have been renamed 'attributes'. This eliminates
  confusion with the accepted meaning of glossary.
- An `AttributeEntry` block element has been added so that document
  attributes can be assigned from within an AsciiDoc document.
- The `AttributeList` block element has been added which is a more
  general solution than the (now deprecated) DelimitedBlock arguments.
- An BlockId element has been added for setting block element anchor
  (link target) IDs.
- Quoted text can now span multiple lines (thanks to James Bowlin for
  this patch).
- Inline macros can now span multiple lines.
- \``double backtick / apostrophe'' quotes generate ``curly quotes''.
- A warning is now emitted for out of order list item (applies to
  explicitly enumerated numbered list items).
- Added `include` action attribute.
- A line of three or more apostrophes generates an HTML horizontal
  ruler (`<hr/>` tag). You will get a warning if processed with
  non-HTML backend.
- An `\{imagesdir}` attribute specifies image file location for images
  referenced in configuration files when generating HTML (the default
  location is `images`).
- An `\{stylesdir}` attribute specifies the location of CSS
  stylesheets when generating styled HTML (the default location for
  configured markup is `.`).
- The use of the (often inappropriately named) `{caption}` attribute
  list entry has been deprecated, use `\{0}` instead.
- New 'ExampleBlock' delimited block along with associated variants
  Note, Tip, Warning, Caution and Important.
- The `docbook.conf` file now facilitates the optional inclusion of a
  DocBook revision history file.
- To better reflect their purpose the following block elements have
  been renamed: `VerbatimBlock` to `ListingBlock`; `IndentedBlock` to
  `LiteralBlock`; `IndentedParagraph` to `LiteralParagraph`;
  `CustomBlock` to `BackendBlock`; `SimpleSection` to `SectionBody`.
  Any corresponding CSS class names have also been changed which could
  result in backward incompatibility in customized stylesheets.
- Swapped plain DocBook admonition icons for Jimmac's DocBook icons
  (http://jimmac.musichall.cz/ikony.php3). The original plain icons
  have been moved to `./images/plain`.
- Renamed `html` backend to `xhtml` to better reflect it's function
  (former `html-4` backend renamed to `html`).
- A new inline anchor macro syntax `[[[<id>]]]` is available, it
  displays `[<id>]` at the anchor location and is for anchoring
  bibliography list entries.
- An optional 'single-line titles' syntax can be used.
- Tweaks to distributed CSS stylesheets and FOP `fo.xsl` customization
  file.
- 'List Item Continuation' has been implemented which allows
  additional block elements to be included in list items by separating
  them from the preceding list item element with a line containing a
  single plus character.
- A new 'Horizontal Labeled List' list type has been added. Generates
  two column list -- the first column contains the list element
  labels, the second contains the element text. Same syntax as
  `Vertical Labeled Lists` except the double colon label suffix is
  followed by the start of the list item text.

.Bug fixes
- Fixed broken backslash line continuation.
- Labeled list end tags were not undergoing attribute substitution.
- Documents without any author information now generate legitimate
  DocBook (previously if the author line was not included in the
  document header then an empty (illegal) DocBook `author` element was
  generated).
- Multiple spaces in filter command arguments were replaced by a
  single space. The `./examples/asciidoc2text/asciidoc2text.sh` script
  now indents text correctly.


Version 5.1.1 (2004-10-10)
--------------------------
*15-December-2004: Interim update:* Updated `asciidoc.py` to fix
broken `join_lines` function -- no other changes.

- PDF documentation is now produced from DocBook XML using XSLTLib and
  FOP. Previously we processed DocBook SGML with `jw(1)` (which used
  Dvips to convert DVI files to PDF). FOP has come a long way in the
  last 12 months and produces very acceptable PDF under both Linux and
  Windows.
- Sections detailing how to install and use the DocBook XSL
  Stylesheets, xsltproc, FOP toolchain and the AsciiDoc XSLT drivers
  have been added to the User Guide.
- The PDF output from the he example article template has been
  included in the distribution (`./doc/article.pdf`).
- Special characters are emitted using decimal Unicode character codes
  (previously used named character entities which cannot be assumed
  included in non-HTML documents).
- Added registered trademark (R) to `[replacements]`.
- CSS stylesheet tweaks.
- Admonitions (Note, Tip, Important, Warning, Caution) include icons
  when generating css output.


Version 5.1.0 (2004-09-18)
--------------------------
- Callouts have been implemented (see the 'Callouts' section of the
  AsciiDoc User Guide for details).
- Added XSL drivers for generating XHTML, chunked XHTML and HTML Help
  from DocBook XML using XSL stylesheets and xsltproc(1).
- Added CSS stylesheet for HTML generated from DocBook XML using XSL
  stylesheets.
- Distribution contains HTML Help formatted User Guide
  (`./doc/asciidoc.chm`), the User Guide tells you how it's generated.
- Images referred to by distributed stylesheets are now located in the
  `./images` subdirectory (previously located in `.`).
- Filters path names are now handled properly under Cygwin.
- The usual documentation and examples additions, updates and
  polishing.


Version 5.0.9 (2004-09-09)
--------------------------
- The convention of using a `.asc` file extension for AsciiDoc files
  has been dropped in favor of the familiar `.txt` extension. It makes
  more sense in that AsciiDoc is a text presentation format and
  because `.asc` clashed with the same extension used by other
  applications.  It's only a naming convention -- you don't have to
  switch if you don't want to.
- Changed the subscript formatting character from underline to tilde
  since underscores in file names are reasonably common (especially in
  link and image macros).
- An alternative syntax for the index term inline macro has been
  added: `++<primary>,<secondary>,<tertiary>++`.
- Index terms that have secondary and tertiary entries now
  additionally generate separate index terms for the secondary and
  tertiary entries.
- A `+<primary>+` index term inline macro has been added which
  displays the term in the primary text flow.
- Added alternative variable list definition using double semi-colon
  terminator as opposed to the standard double colon terminator so
  variable lists can be nested to two levels.
- Footnotes now appear on a separate line in HTML and Linuxdoc
  outputs.
- Python version compatibility is checked at startup.
- Preface and appendix section titles in multi-part Book documents are
  meant to be out of sequence -- warnings are no longer emitted when
  outputting HTML.
- Empty section warnings have been replaced by error messages and are
  emitted only if invalid markup would result.
- Missing macro sections or invalid macro name warnings are only
  generated at startup if the `-v` (verbose) option is set. Otherwise
  they are deferred until a matching macro is encountered in the input
  file.
- Missing or invalid table definition warnings are only generated at
  startup if the `-v` (verbose) option is set. Otherwise they are
  deferred until a matching table is encountered in the input file.
- AsciiDoc now makes more of an effort to continue in the face of
  errors.
- Fixed broken `./examples/website/main.aap` script.
- Converted distribution text files DOS text format as a sop to
  Windows users with challenged text editors.
- Documentation additions and corrections.


Version 5.0.8 (2004-05-15)
--------------------------
- Spurious 'out of sequence' level 2 warnings no longer appear when
  processing 'book' document multi-part book top level Preface and
  Appendix sub-sections since they are (correctly) out of sequence.
- A warning is no longer emitted for empty Index sections since this
  is normal when generating DocBook outputs.
- Fixed: `[quotes]` configuration file entries where not being
  overridden by downstream configuration file entries.
- Footnote text is now output enclosed in square brackets in HTML
  documents.
- Added superscripts and subscripts to the standard PRS configuration
  files.
- Adjusted CSS stylesheets so list titles don't have so much space
  between title and first list item (broken in IE6 due to poor CSS
  compliance). Lessened sidebar title top margin.


Version 5.0.7 (2004-04-22)
--------------------------
- The version 5.0.6 README incorrectly stated that AsciiDoc would run
  under Python 2.0, in fact it requires Python 2.1 or better. The
  README has been corrected.
- Documented techniques for combining and splitting AsciiDoc documents
  and processing the combined and split parts (see the 'Tips and
  Tricks' section of the User Guide).
- An example of marking up superscripts and subscripts is documented
  in the 'Tips and Tricks' section of the User Guide (the example
  configuration file is in the AsciiDoc `examples` directory).
- Added ellipsis to shipped `[replacements]`; three periods output an
  ellipsis entity.
- Removed unused 'SectionClose' class.
- The AsciiDoc 'Preamble' element is output as a DocBook 'Preface'
  when processed as a 'book' document type (in older AsciiDoc versions
  a warning was issued and processing stopped).
- Fixed a quoting anomaly: quoted text can no longer begin or end with
  with white space.


Version 5.0.6 (2004-03-07)
--------------------------
- New 'image' macro implements optional image scaling and linking and
  works in both inline and block contexts. The 'image' macro obsolesces
  the existing 'graphic' block macro and 'icon' inline macro.
- Macro substitution section names now have `-inlinemacro` and
  `-blockmacro` suffixes to resolve context ambiguity, make their
  purpose clearer and relieve section namespace congestion.
- Header derived glossary entries can now be overridden from the
  command-line.
- Special character substitution is now performed on AuthorLine
  derived author names.
- A macro or block argument called 'options' can be used as a shortcut
  for a list named arguments with zero length string values.
- Tables can be output without borders using the `options="noborders"`
  argument.
- Table data lines that do not immediately follow a table section
  underline can now be blank. This allows CSV data with embedded blank
  lines to be processed correctly.
- Blank DSV format table data lines are silently skipped.
- Tightened up on enforcement of configuration file section names to
  reduce the possibility of section content being seen as a section
  header line.
- Section titles can be optionally suffixed with title arguments
  enclosed in double square brackets.
- A replacement has been added to `asciidoc.conf` to replace inline
  double dashes with the `&mdash;` entity.
- Changed the `.UNDER-CONSTRUCTION.` macro syntax to
  `#UNDER-CONSTRUCTION#` so it is not mistaken for a BlockTitle.
  Similarly changed the `.NEW.` replacement with
  `&#35;NEW&#35;`.
- `&#35;NEW&#35;` and `#UNDER-CONSTRUCTION#` macros are now
  included in the DocBook backend.
- Replaced shipped `smallnew.gif` with `smallnew.png`.
- Documentation tidy ups.


Version 5.0.5 (2004-02-25)
--------------------------
- Fixed the disappearing paragraph titles problem that was caused by
  Inline macros (incorrectly) processing BlockTitles.
- Tightened AuthorLine validation.  Previously invalid email addresses
  and embedded special characters in the AuthorLine resulted in
  invalid output markup.


Version 5.0.4 (2004-02-09)
--------------------------
- Reinstated missing `infile`, `outfile`, `filetype` and
  `filetype-<filetype>` glossary entries.
- As of version 5.0.3 asciidoc(1) now requires Python 2.0 or greater,
  this has now been documented.


Version 5.0.3 (2004-01-23)
--------------------------
- Fixed problem that caused any filters directory file containing
  `.conf` (not just those with the `.conf` extension) from being
  loaded.
- All `[miscellaneous]` configuration file entries can now be
  referenced like glossary entries (they are now processed internally
  as glossary entries).
- The output file line terminator (previously hardwired to `\r\n` is
  now set using the `newline` entry in the configuration file
  `[miscellaneous]` section.
- The misspelt `blocktitles` configuration file entry name has been
  corrected (to `blocktitle`).
- An `\{empty}` glossary entry has been added to the default
  configuration which is useful for outputting trailing blank lines
  from configuration file substitution sections.


Version 5.0.2 (2003-12-18)
--------------------------
- New (alternative) 'anchor' and 'xref' macro syntax (old syntax still
  valid).
- DocBook `mediaobject` and `inlinemediaobject` tags are generated in
  place of `graphic` and `inlinegraphic` tags by the AsciiDoc
  `graphic` and `icon` macros. If a macro argument is specified it is
  the alternative text output if the target document format does not
  support the specified graphic file format.
- Dropped the LinuxDoc left and right square bracket special character
  substitutions as they interfered with macro substitution.
- Documentation updates and corrections.


Version 5.0.1 (2003-12-09)
--------------------------
- Fixed problem with anchor tag when generating CSS styled HTML.


Version 5.0 (2003-12-08)
------------------------
***************************************************
This release has had some fairly major code and
documentation changes. Please report any problems
you encounter.

mailto:srackham@gmail.com['Stuart Rackham']
***************************************************

- AsciiDoc can now produce a full-blown multi-part DocBook book
  including dedication, abstract, preface, colophon, glossary,
  appendix, bibliography and book part elements using the new
  `specialsections` configuration file section.
- All Section element children (Paragraph, DelimitedBlock, List,
  Table, BlockMacro) can now be titled using the BlockTitle element.
  A BlockTitle element is a single line containing a title and
  beginning with a period.
- The `index` and `backmatter` macros have been dropped, superseded by
  `specialsections`.
- The AsciiDoc 'Preface' element has been renamed 'Preamble' (to avoid
  confusion with the DocBook book preface element).
- Out of sequence titles are now tolerated with a warning. This allows
  book document level 0 sections to be processed.
- An 'anchor' inline macro has been added for document link target
  creation.
- 'Note', 'Tip', 'Important' and 'Warning' paragraph types have been
  added to support the corresponding DocBook elements.
- Title substitution is now performed in SidebarBlock titles.
- DocBook graphics now output as `figure` and `informalfigure`
  elements rather than `mediaobjects`. This ensures numbered figures
  and a lists of figures are produced by the DocBook toolchain.
- You can now escape block argument lines by appending a backslash.
  Alternatively, if you embed arguments in the delimiter line AsciiDoc
  does not check for an arguments line.
- The default DocBook backend file extension has been changed from
  `.docbook` to `.xml` (`.sgml` for the 'docbook-sgml' backend).
- Warnings are output by default (previously they only printed when
  verbose option enabled).
- A Question and Answer variable list definition has been added to the
  shipped configuration files, primarily to create DocBook `qanda`
  DocBook elements.
- Fixed broken code-filter `-b linuxdoc` option. The asciidoc.asc User
  Guide can now be processed by linuxdoc(1) (although tables are
  dropped because LinuxDoc does not implement tables).

.Compatibility issues:
1. Table titles are no longer in the arguments line, use the new
   BlockTitles.
2. Graphic titles are no longer in the 'graphic' block macro caption,
   use the new BlockTitles.
3. The code-filter title must be placed in a preceding BlockTitle.
4. SidebarBlock titles must be placed in a preceding BlockTitle.
5. The DelimitedBlock option 'sidebar' has been renamed to 'section'.
6. The default DocBook backend file extension has been changed from
`.docbook` to `.xml` (`.sgml` for the 'docbook-sgml' backend).


Version 4.2 (2003-11-26)
------------------------
- The default HTML output is now XHTML 1.0 markup. To output the
  former HTML 4 markup specify the `html-4` backend.
- The default DocBook output is now DocBook XML. To output the former
  DocBook SGML specify the `docbook-sgml` backend. The associated
  `docbook-sgml.conf` file illustrates how to support minor DTD
  variations. Examples of using the `xmlto(1)` command for DocBook
  conversion have been added to the User Guide.
- Glossary entries set using the command-line -g option can now be
  referenced in configuration files.
- Configuration dumps (`-c` command-line option) no longer output
  redundant undefined glossary entries.
- DelimitedBlock arguments can now be specified in a separate arguments
  line immediately following the leading delimiter line, This is in
  preference to the existing delimiter embedded arguments. Reasons:
  * The syntax is in keeping with the Tables arguments syntax.
  * It's easier to enter and implements line continuation.
- A new QuoteBlock DelimitedBlock definition has been added to the
  distribution configuration files.
- The table arguments lines can be continued using the backslash line
  continuation character.
- Added new calculated glossary reference type `\{<name>%<value>}`.
- Double-quote characters can now appear in unquoted positional
  arguments.


Version 4.1 (2003-11-13)
------------------------
- Added DSV (Delimiter Separated Values) tables format.
- `\{eval:<expr>}` glossary references drop the containing line if
  `<expr>` evaluates to `None`.
- Block, Table and Macro arguments can now be positional (quoted or
  unquoted).
- Vocabulary change: DelimitedBlock, Table and Macro 'attributes' are
  now referred to as 'arguments'. This makes more sense in light of the
  extended syntax and avoids confusion with backend markup tag
  attributes.
- 'tablewidth' table ruler parameter can now be expressed in percent
  units (0..100). If between 0 and 1 then the original fractional unit
  measure is applied.
- The use of quoting for generating footnotes and index entries has
  been dropped in favor of 'footnote' and 'indexterm' inline macros.
- 'backmatter' inline macro included in distribution.
- Fixed: CSS styled HTML tables are now fully XHTML 1.0 conformant.
- Fixed: 'tablewidth' was processed incorrectly when passed as table
  argument.
- Fixed: Glossary references like `\{x=\{y}}` were one character off
  if \{x] was defined and `\{y}` was not.


Version 4.0 (2003-11-08)
------------------------
***************************************************
This release has had some fairly major code and
documentation changes. Please report any problems
you encounter.

'Stuart Rackham'
***************************************************

- Added tables to AsciiDoc.
- Added two special 'subs' options: 'default' specifies the default
  substitution options and 'none' specifies no substitution.  These
  options can only appear singly.
- Line continuation using a trailing backslash character is available
  in Paragraphs, ListItems, Tables.
- The left and right quotes for quoted text can now be specified
  separately.
- Shipped configuration files implement footnotes (only useful for
  DocBook output) using \[[]] quoting.
- Shipped configuration files implement index terms (only useful for
  DocBook and LinuxDoc output) using \(()) quoting.
- The shipped 'html' backend configuration now emits valid 'HTML 4.01
  Transitional'.
- Added new calculated glossary reference types `\{<name>!<value>}`
  and `\{<name>#<value>}`.
- The DelimitedBlock 'params' option has been dropped in favor of the
  new 'block attributes' mechanism. If you have customized block
  params options you may need to adjust source files to use the
  'block attributes' syntax. The example code filter has been updated
  to reflect these changes.
- The code filter now has a `-t tabsize` option.
- Replaced `-w` option with `-v` (verbose) option. The warnings option
  was just to confusing.
- Named attributes can now be specified in macro calls.
- The 'tabsize' attribute is recognized in the built-in `include`
  macros. A tabsize of zero suppresses tab expansion.
- The configuration file `[options]` section has been split into
  `[miscellaneous]` and `[titles]`. If you have customized any of
  these settings you will need to adjust the affected configuration
  files.
- Configuration file `[miscellaneous]` entries can now also be set
  using the command-line `-g` option.
- Fixed: error that occurred when attempting to use zero length
  configuration and source files.
- Fixed: blocking filter halt problem.
- Fixed: inline macro escape prefix problem.
- Fixed: missing macros from configuration dump problem.
- Fixed: named macros were dumped incorrectly.
- Many documentation changes/additions/corrections.


Version 3.2.2 (2003-10-26)
--------------------------
- Added `-n` option (synonym for `-g section-numbers`).
- Dropped the processing commentary (hey, this is Unix).
- Added new calculated glossary reference type `\{<name>?<value>}`.
  `<name>` is the glossary entry name and `<value>` is the text
  substituted if the glossary entry is defined. `<value>` can only
  contain literal text (no glossary references allowed).
- Added `asciidoc2text` to distribution `examples/asciidoc2text`
  directory (converts AsciiDoc source to text file with section
  numbering).
- Fixed incorrect nesting of Simple lists inside Variable lists.
- List definitions have been modified so that list items can be
  indented. This allows a more intuitive indentation of nested lists
  in AsciiDoc source.
- Lists must be separated from preceding paragraphs by a blank line.
  This is to avoid paragraph lines being mistaken for list items.
- Corrected asciidoc man page documentation error: the`-f` option does
  *not* search relative to source document directory for the
  configuration file.
- Minor updates to various distribution `.conf` files.
- Included `badges.conf` in `examples` directory.
- `css-embedded-stylesheet.conf` now supports footer badges.
- The default in-line element processing order has been changed:
  Glossary References are now processed before Inline Macros. This
  allows glossary expansions to occur inside macro references.
- Glossary entries are now allowed in Author and Revision lines.
- Default List `subs` options and Paragraph `presubs` options are
  assigned the following default value if not specified:

  specialcharacters,quotes,specialwords,replacements,glossary,macros

- Documentation changes/additions/corrections.


Version 3.2 (2003-05-26)
------------------------
- Added a `-s` command-line option to suppress the output of
  `[header]` and `[footer]` sections.
- Article document headers are no longer mandatory: this allows
  AsciiDoc to process arbitrary chunks of text. When used in
  conjunction with the new `-s` command-line option corresponding
  chunks of backend markup can be generated.
- AsciiDoc now emits a warning message and continues when an out of
  sequence section title is detected (previously it failed and
  halted). This allows document sections to be processed separately.
- Optional 'presubs' and 'postsubs' entries have been added to
  'DelimitedBlock' and 'Paragraph' definitions. As a consequence
  substitution options are no longer legal in 'options' entries.
- 'presubs' and 'postsubs' substitutions are processed in the order
  the options are specified (rather than the fixed 'options' order of
  previous versions).
- ./filters subdirectories are automatically searched for filter
  commands.
- A 'title-subs' configuration option specifies the substitutions
  performed on document Header and Section titles.
- A 'subs' entry in now included in List configuration file
  definitions that specified substitutions performed on list entry
  text.
- Configuration files are auto-loaded from ./filters subdirectories.
- Added example code filter (see ./examples/filters).
- Bug fix: if section was empty you may have got erroneous 'missing
  tag "paragraph"' error.
- Internal code tidy up.


Version 3.1 (2003-05-18)
------------------------
- In version 3.0 a `[macros]` section entry of the form 'name' was
  equivalent to 'name='. An entry of the form 'name' now undefines the
  entry (to bring it in line with the behavior of other special
  sections).
- Paragraphs have now been generalized (in the same way as Lists and
  DelimitedBlocks).
- The 'indentsize' option has been dropped as as consequence of
  paragraph generalization.
- Pipe | characters can be included in substituted tag and
  substitution section text using the \{brvbar} (broken vertical bar)
  glossary reference.
- Removed the restriction requiring substitution section text
  placeholders | to be on a separate line.
- Added an `-e` asciidoc(1) command option that excludes implicit
  configuration files (used in conjunction with `-c` generated
  configuration files).
- Version 3.0 documentation has undergone a considerable cleanup.
- The dumping of quoted section entries (see `-c` option) now works
  correctly.
- The format of special section entries has been made consistent:
  `name` undefines the entry; `name=` sets the entry value to a blank
  string; `name=value` sets the entry value to `value`.
- As a consequence of the previous change the caret prefix is no
  longer used in glossary configuration file entries (although it is
  still used when undefining an entry using the `-g` command-line
  option).


Version 3.0 (2003-05-13)
------------------------
This version is the culmination of work begun in the 2.x releases
whereby fixed policy has been replaced by extensible mechanisms.

- Added `-c` command-line option to dump a composite asciidoc(1)
  configuration file to stdout.
- Lists and Delimited Blocks are now defined by a set of configuration
  file parameter sections.  The user can modify the default
  definitions or add new ones.
- Block content can now be processed through external filters.
- The default behavior for Custom Blocks is to perform glossary
  substitution (previously there was no substitution inside Custom
  Blocks).
- The old 2.x style macros have been reimplemented; as with Lists and
  Delimited Blocks there syntax and behavior can be configured by the
  user. The default macro syntax remains the same but the semantics
  are now (hopefully) a bit more intelligible.
- Block and Builtin macros use :: delimiter instead of the 2.x single
  colon delimit (to distinguish them from inline macros). The 2.x
  syntax is still supported for backward compatibility.
- Nested lists are now supported and IndentedParagraphs can be
  included in list items.
- Conditional source inclusion can be specified using built in `ifdef`,
  `ifndef` and `endif` macros.
- The new conditional source inclusion feature has been used to reduce
  the number of default configuration files down to one per backend.
- A change of name: 2.x 'Substitutions' are now called 'Replacements'
  and the 2.x `[substitutions]` configuration file section is now
  called `[replacements]` (the old name is still recognized for
  backward compatibility).
- The line break is now implemented as a 'Replacements' substitution.
- Inline 'icon' macro for inline images has been added to default
  configuration files.

Version 2.2 (2003-04-07)
------------------------
- The `master.conf` configuration file name has been deprecated in
  favor of `asciidoc.conf`.
- The standard configuration files set is now loaded from the
  `.asciidoc` folder in the users home directory (if it exists) and
  then from the source document directory. Configuration files that
  don't exist are silently skipped.
- Configuration files named like the source file will be automatically
  loaded if they are found in the source file directory. For example
  if the source file is `mydoc.asc` and the `-b html` option is used
  then asciidoc(1) will look for `mydoc.conf` and `mydoc-html.conf` in
  that order.
- The characters used to quote formatted text can be configured and
  extended by the user (see the master.conf [quotes] section).
- Quoted text can now be escaped by prefixing a backslash character to
  the leading quote.
- The double single-quote '' strong text quote has been deprecated in
  favor of an asterisk * character.
- Added \{eval:expression}, \{sys:command} and \{sys2:command}
  glossary reference actions.
- Trailing brace characters `}` are now allowed inside glossary
  references provided they are escaped with a backslash character.
- Glossary entries can now be escaped by prefixing a backslash
  character to the leading brace character (use this in preference to
  placing the backslash inside the brace).
- The output macro has been deprecated (use the new include1 macro
  inside a CustomBlock).
- The default document type is `article` (asciidoc no longer attempts
  to guess).
- Files included within DelimitedBlocks are not searched for block
  termination underlines. This ensures the entire file is part of the
  DelimitedBlock.
- `include` macros can now be used in configuration files.
- Corrected \{infile} and \{outfile} glossary entry documentation.
- File inclusion is now limited to a depth of 5 to catch recursion
  loops.
- Inline tags have been deprecated, they're not necessary and they
  immediately make the source document backend specific. Use
  CustomBlocks or Substitutions instead.

Version 2.1 (2003-03-17)
------------------------
- Added section auto numbering `\{sectnum}` glossary entry
  (auto-numbering function contributed by Ludovico Magnocavallo).
- asciidoc(1) now correctly returns non-zero exit status if an error
  occurs.
- An AsciiDoc example website has been included in the AsciiDoc
  distribution `examples/website` directory (also online at
  http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/examples/website/).
- NOTE: The `asciidoc` wrapper script included in the 2.0 distribution
  has been dropped, if you've symlinked or aliased to `asciidoc` you'll
  need to change them to point directly to `asciidoc.py` instead.
- An RCS $Id$ marker can be used as the  document header revision line
  (based on a patch submitted by Ludovico Magnocavallo).
- In addition to the `name=value` glossary entry format two new ones
  have been introduced: `name` (the default value is set to an empty
  string) and `^name` (the glossary entry is undefined).
- The `-q` command-line option has been deprecated and the `-w level`
  command-line option added. +
  NOTE: By default skipped substitution warnings are now suppressed.
- If a configuration file specified with the `-f` command-line option
  is not found relative to the current working directory then the
  search is repeated relative to the asciidoc(1) directory. This
  allows global configuration files to be used.
- Added `\{infile}`, `\{outfile}` predefined glossary entries.
- Added `under-construction` macro to HTML article configuration
  files.
- Deprecated `\{asciidoc_version}` glossary entry in favor of
  `\{asciidoc-version}` (to it consistent with other entries).

Version 2.0 (2003-02-24)
------------------------
- The emphasized, strong and monospaced words options have been
  generalized with the introduction of macro based 'special words'
  lists.
- Glossary references can now appear in both the document and macro
  bodies.
- All output files use `crlf` line termination (previously used UNIX
  `lf` (newline) termination).
- Added [substitutions] section which implements arbitrary regular
  expression based substitutions.
- An optional `master.conf` configuration file can be used for entries
  that are not backend or document type specific.
- Special character definitions moved from the code to the new
  [special_characters] configuration file section.
- Configuration file glossary added.
- Command-line -g glossary entry added.
- A new 'book' document type has been implemented for the 'docbook'
  backend. It outputs DocBook 'book' documents.
- A major internal change has been the implementation of parametrized
  user definable 'macros'. Internally most document elements are now
  processed as macros.
- Configuration file macro variables can be specified with default
  values (literals or other macro variables).
- An attempt has been made to tighten up the vocabulary used to
  describe the AsciiDoc document syntax.
- The term abstract has been replaced by the more general term
  'preface' and a new preface section introduced into article
  configuration files (replacing the synopsis sections).
- Any section elements can now be put in the document preface
  (previous versions only allowed paragraphs).
- AsciiDoc Blocks have been unified and their behavior can be user
  defined and parametrized.
- An 'output' inclusion allows an external file to be written directly
  to the backend output file.
- A new CustomBlock has been added. Default behavior is to insert the
  enveloped AsciiDoc source lines directly into the output file.
- A 'line break' tag can be inserted by terminating a line with a '+'
  character (only really useful for HTML backends).
- An fourth section level has been introduced.
- The SidebarBlock delimiter line characters have been changed. The
  deprecated underline is still accepted.
- Levels 2 and 3 title underline characters have been changed.  The
  deprecated underlines are still accepted.
- Lines with backend specific inline tags can be inserted into
  AsciiDoc source files.
- Single words enveloped by underscores are no longer emphasized. This
  feature was deprecated as it is redundant (use single quotes
  instead) and was being applied to file names with underscores.
- A `-q` quiet option has been added to suppress warning messages.
- Badge images sourced locally.
- Added 'author' and 'author-mail' meta tags to HTML configuration
  files.

Version 1.5 (2003-01-08)
------------------------
- Implemented sidebar document elements.
- Explicit checks for user specified configuration files and input
  file (rather than throwing exception).

Version 1.4 (2003-01-04)
------------------------
- New configuration file options 'emphasizedwords' and 'strongwords'.
  These allow the definition of words that will always be emphasized
  or rendered in a strong font without inline formatting.
- Document and section titles are no long subject to inline
  formatting.
- Multiple configuration files can be overlaid in a single command.
- Configuration file tags and options entries can now be overridden on
  an entry by entry basis (previously the entire section was
  overloaded).
- Configuration file tags and options entries are now cached this has
  resulted in around 37% performance improvement over version 1.3.
- Variable lists can now contain multiple terms per list item.
- Placeholder paragraph eliminated from empty sections that contain
  subsections.
- Added \{asciidoc_version} substitution variable.
- More documentation additions and tidy ups.

Version 1.3 (2003-01-01)
------------------------
- A new 'strong' text formatting convention has been implemented:
  Word phrases enclosed in pairs of single quote characters (acute
  accents) are rendered in a strong font (usually bold).
- Paragraphs can now be followed immediately by Simple lists and
  Ordered lists without an intervening blank line.
- A user specified configuration file (`asciidoc(1)` -f option)
  overlays the default configuration file rather than replacing it.
  Custom configuration files need only contain those sections
  that have been customized.
- Comment Block delimiters have been relaxed slightly. They must start
  with three forward slashes /// but the remainder can contain any
  characters, this allows comments to be embedded in the delimiter line.
- Leading non-digit characters preceding revision number are now
  ignored.
- Set default indentsize [option] from 2 to documented default value
  of zero in HTML backend html-article.conf and html-manpage.conf
  files.
- Fixed error that occurred when taking input from stdin without
  explicitly specifying a document type.
- Restored file name and line number error message information.
- Changed deprecated -t option to -d in asciidoc --help and usage
  command output.
- CSS styles tweaking.
- Code, configuration file and documentation tidy ups.

Version 1.2 (2002-12-28)
------------------------
- Implemented 'include' URL to allow file inclusion.
- `fileextension` configuration file [option] renamed to more sensible
  `outfilesuffix` (`fileextension` still accepted by this version but
  will be dropped in future).
- Improved error reporting.
- CSS backends generate valid XHTML.
- New `css-embedded` backend generates HTML with embedded stylesheets
  (use the `css` backend for linked stylesheets). The css-embedded
  backend output contains no linked images so the generated html files
  are completely self contained.
- Bug fixes.

Version 1.1 (2002-12-03)
------------------------
- Added css (cascading style sheets) backend
- Implemented IndentedBlock document element.
- Tabsize command-line option has been deprecated in
  favor of configuration file.
- Default indent width changed to zero.
- Added \{localdate} and \{localtime} substitution variables.
- Added optional [options] configuration file section with
  fileextension, tabsize and indentsize options.
- Implemented \{authorinitials} substitution variable.
- Added https link type.
- Corrected [graphic] substitution from \{title} to \{caption}
  in linuxdoc-article.conf configuration file.
- Fixed error that occurred when '==' title underline was
  used.

Version 1.0 (2002-11-25)
------------------------
First AsciiDoc public release along with AsciiDoc web site
(http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) and SourceForge.net project registration
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/asciidoc/[]).
