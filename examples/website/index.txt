.{date}: AsciiDoc {revision} Released
************************************************************************
This is a significant release containing major additions and changes.
There are a few fairly minor backward compatibility issues, please
read the link:CHANGELOG.html[Compatibility issues] section in the
CHANGLOG before upgrading.

- AsciiDoc tables have been redesigned.  The link:newtables.html[new
  syntax and features] are a huge improvement over the old tables. The
  old tables syntax has been deprecated but is currently still
  processed.
- Lists can now be styled like other block elements. This allows a
  single list syntax for 'glossary', 'qanda' (Question and Answer) and
  'bibliography' lists instead of having to remember a different
  syntax for each type.  link:newlists.html[Here is some more
  information].
- Inline passthroughs macros have been improved and block passthrough
  macros added. Attribute substitution can be optionally specified
  when the macro is called.
- The passthrough block has a fully transparent passthrough delimited
  block block style called 'pass'.
- The 'asciimath' and 'latexmath' web:userguide.html#X77[passthrough
  macros] along with 'asciimath' and 'latexmath'
  web:userguide.html#X76[passthrough blocks] provide a (backend
  dependent) mechanism for rendering mathematical formulas. There are
  web:latexmath.pdf[LaTeX Math], web:asciimathml.html[AsciiMathML] and
  web:latexmathml.html[LaTeXMathML] examples on the AsciiDoc website.

Read the link:CHANGELOG.html[CHANGELOG] for a full list of all
additions and changes.

Introduction
------------
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing short documents,
articles, books and UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files can be translated
to HTML and DocBook markups using the asciidoc(1) command.

AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax
and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of
SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.

TIP: The pages you are reading were written using AsciiDoc, to view
the corresponding AsciiDoc source click on the *Page Source* menu item
in the left hand margin.


Overview and Examples
---------------------
You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a
normal text document, there are no markup tags or weird format
notations. AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and
printed directly or translated to other presentation formats using
the asciidoc(1) command.

The asciidoc(1) command translates AsciiDoc files to HTML, XHTML and
DocBook markups.  DocBook can be post-processed to presentation
formats such as HTML, PDF, DVI, LaTeX, roff, and Postscript using
readily available Open Source tools.

Example Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- This version of the
  link:asciidoc.css-embedded.html[AsciiDoc User Guide]
  was generated by AsciiDoc from
  link:asciidoc.txt[this AsciiDoc file].

- Here's the link:asciidoc.html[same document] created by first
  generating DocBook markup using AsciiDoc and then converting the
  DocBook markup to HTML using 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.

- The User Guide again, this time a
  link:chunked/index.html[chunked version].

- This link:article.txt[AsciiDoc article template] produced
  this link:article.html[HTML file] and this
  link:article.pdf[PDF file] via DocBook markup generated by AsciiDoc.

- This link:asciidoc.pdf[PDF formatted User Guide] was generated from
  asciidoc(1) DocBook output.

Example Books
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc markup supports all the standard DocBook frontmatter and
backmatter sections (dedication, preface, bibliography, glossary,
index, colophon) plus footnotes and index entries.

Book::
    This link:book.txt[AsciiDoc book's] DocBook output
    produced link:book.html[this HTML file] using the
    'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.

Multi-part book::
    This link:book-multi.txt[multi-part AsciiDoc book's]
    DocBook output produced link:book-multi.html[this HTML file]
    using the 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.

Example UNIX Man Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTML formatted AsciiDoc man pages
link:asciidoc.1.css-embedded.html[with stylesheets] and
link:asciidoc.1.html[without stylesheets] were generated by AsciiDoc
from link:asciidoc.1.txt[this file].

This link:asciidoc.1[roff formatted  man page] was generated from
asciidoc(1) DocBook output using `xsltproc(1)` and DocBook XSL
Stylesheets.
  
Example Web Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The link:README-website.html[AsciiDoc website] is included in the
AsciiDoc distribution (in `./examples/website/`) as example website
built using AsciiDoc.  See `./examples/website/README-website.txt`.


Music Filter
------------
A link:music-filter.html[music filter] is included in the distribution
`./filters/` directory. It translates music in
http://lilypond.org/[LilyPond] or http://abcnotation.org.uk/[ABC]
notation to standard classical notation


Source Code Highlight Filter
----------------------------
A link:source-highlight-filter.html[source code highlight filter] is
included in the distribution `./filters/` directory.


[[X3]]
Mathematical Formulae
---------------------
You can include mathematical formulae in AsciiDoc XHTML documents using
link:asciimathml.html[ASCIIMathML] or link:latexmathml.html[LaTeXMathML]
notation.

link:latexmath.pdf[LaTeX Math] can be included in AsciiDoc
documents processed by `dblatex(1)`.


Vim Syntax Highlighter
----------------------
An AsciiDoc syntax highlighter for the Vim text editor is included in
the AsciiDoc distribution (see 'Appendix F' of the 'AsciiDoc User
Guide' for details).

Dag Wieers has implemented an alternative Vim syntax file for AsciiDoc
which can be found here

LaTeX Backend
-------------
An experimental LaTeX backend has been written for AsciiDoc by
Benjamin Klum.  Benjamin has done a superhuman job (I admit it, I
didn't think this was doable due to AsciiDoc's SGML/XML bias).

Here's link:latex-backend.html[Benjamin's documentation].
